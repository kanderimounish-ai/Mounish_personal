What’s a Database?
A database is an organized place where data is stored so you can easily access, manage, and update it.

What’s a DBMS? (Database Management System)
A DBMS is software that helps you create, store, retrieve, and manage data in a database.

What’s SQL? (Structured Query Language)
SQL is the language used to communicate with a database to store, read, and modify data.

What is a Schema?
A schema is the blueprint or structure of the database, describing tables and relationships.

SQL Execution

Order of Execution in SQL
SQL runs in this order: FROM → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → SELECT → ORDER BY → LIMIT.

SQL Command Types

DDL (Data Definition Language)
DDL commands create or change database structures (CREATE, ALTER, DROP).

DML (Data Manipulation Language)
DML commands insert, update, or delete data (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

DQL (Data Query Language)
DQL retrieves data (SELECT).

DCL (Data Control Language)
DCL controls access to data (GRANT, REVOKE).

TCL (Transaction Control Language)
TCL manages transaction changes (COMMIT, ROLLBACK).

Basic Commands

CREATE DATABASE
Used to make a new database.

CREATE TABLE
Used to define a new table with columns and data types.

INSERT INTO
Adds new rows of data into a table.

SELECT
Fetches data from a table.

ALTER TABLE
Modifies an existing table’s structure.

Constraints

NOT NULL
Prevents a column from storing empty values.

UNIQUE
Ensures all values in a column are different.

PRIMARY KEY
Uniquely identifies each row in a table.

FOREIGN KEY
Creates a connection between two tables.

CHECK
Ensures values meet a specific condition.

DEFAULT
Sets a pre-defined value when none is provided.

Delete Operations

DROP
Permanently removes a table or database.

DELETE
Removes specific rows from a table.

TRUNCATE
Removes all rows from a table faster than DELETE but keeps structure.

Useful Operations

COUNT
Counts rows.

DISTINCT COUNT
Counts unique values.

SELECT Specific Columns
Retrieves only the columns you choose.

LIMIT
Restricts how many rows are returned.

WHERE
Filters rows based on conditions.

ORDER BY
Sorts results in ascending or descending order.

Operators

AND
Requires all conditions to be true.

OR
Requires at least one condition to be true.

NOT
Excludes data that meets a condition.

LIKE
Searches for a pattern in text.

NULL Value
Represents missing or unknown data.

BETWEEN
Filters values within a range.

Grouping

GROUP BY
Groups rows by values in a column (usually for aggregation).

HAVING
Filters groups after GROUP BY.

Difference Between WHERE and HAVING
WHERE filters rows before grouping; HAVING filters groups after grouping.

String Functions

'strings'
Text values stored in a column.

SUBSTRING
Extracts part of a string.

CONCAT
Joins strings together.

LENGTH
Returns how long a string is.

LOCATE + SUBSTRING
Finds a word and extracts based on its position.

SUBSTRING_INDEX
Splits a string and returns part of it before or after a delimiter.

Math + Date

Math Functions
Perform arithmetic calculations.

DATEDIFF
Returns difference between two dates.

DATETIME
Stores date and time together.

CASTING
Converts data from one type to another.

Relationships

1:1 Relationship
One record connects to exactly one record in another table.

1:Many Relationship
One record connects to multiple records.

Many:1 Relationship
Many records connect to one record.

Many:Many Relationship
Records in both tables connect to multiple records, usually via a bridge table.

Joins

INNER JOIN
Returns only matching records between tables.

LEFT JOIN
Returns all records from left table + matching from right.

RIGHT JOIN
Returns all from right table + matching from left.

FULL OUTER JOIN
Returns all records whether matched or not.

Simulated FULL JOIN
Achieved by UNION of LEFT + RIGHT joins.

CROSS JOIN
Returns every combination of rows (cartesian product).

SELF JOIN
Joins a table with itself.

DISTINCT + JOINS
Removes duplicate rows after joining tables.
