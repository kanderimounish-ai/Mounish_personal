What’s a Database?
A database is an organized place where data is stored so you can easily access, manage, and update it.

What’s a DBMS? (Database Management System)
A DBMS is software that helps you create, store, retrieve, and manage data in a database.

What’s SQL? (Structured Query Language)
SQL is the language used to communicate with a database to store, read, and modify data.

What is a Schema?
A schema is the blueprint or structure of the database, describing tables and relationships.

SQL Execution

Order of Execution in SQL
SQL runs in this order: FROM → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → SELECT → ORDER BY → LIMIT.

SQL Command Types

DDL (Data Definition Language)
DDL commands create or change database structures (CREATE, ALTER, DROP).

DML (Data Manipulation Language)
DML commands insert, update, or delete data (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

DQL (Data Query Language)
DQL retrieves data (SELECT).

DCL (Data Control Language)
DCL controls access to data (GRANT, REVOKE).

TCL (Transaction Control Language)
TCL manages transaction changes (COMMIT, ROLLBACK).

Basic Commands

CREATE DATABASE
Used to make a new database.

CREATE TABLE
Used to define a new table with columns and data types.

INSERT INTO
Adds new rows of data into a table.

SELECT
Fetches data from a table.

ALTER TABLE
Modifies an existing table’s structure.

Constraints

NOT NULL
Prevents a column from storing empty values.

UNIQUE
Ensures all values in a column are different.

PRIMARY KEY
Uniquely identifies each row in a table.

FOREIGN KEY
Creates a connection between two tables.

CHECK
Ensures values meet a specific condition.

DEFAULT
Sets a pre-defined value when none is provided.

Delete Operations

DROP
Permanently removes a table or database.

DELETE
Removes specific rows from a table.

TRUNCATE
Removes all rows from a table faster than DELETE but keeps structure.

Useful Operations

COUNT
Counts rows.

DISTINCT COUNT
Counts unique values.

SELECT Specific Columns
Retrieves only the columns you choose.

LIMIT
Restricts how many rows are returned.

WHERE
Filters rows based on conditions.

ORDER BY
Sorts results in ascending or descending order.

Operators

AND
Requires all conditions to be true.

OR
Requires at least one condition to be true.

NOT
Excludes data that meets a condition.

LIKE
Searches for a pattern in text.

NULL Value
Represents missing or unknown data.

BETWEEN
Filters values within a range.

Grouping

GROUP BY
Groups rows by values in a column (usually for aggregation).

HAVING
Filters groups after GROUP BY.

Difference Between WHERE and HAVING
WHERE filters rows before grouping; HAVING filters groups after grouping.

String Functions

'strings'
Text values stored in a column.

SUBSTRING
Extracts part of a string.

CONCAT
Joins strings together.

LENGTH
Returns how long a string is.

LOCATE + SUBSTRING
Finds a word and extracts based on its position.

SUBSTRING_INDEX
Splits a string and returns part of it before or after a delimiter.

Math + Date

Math Functions
Perform arithmetic calculations.

DATEDIFF
Returns difference between two dates.

DATETIME
Stores date and time together.

CASTING
Converts data from one type to another.

Relationships

1:1 Relationship
One record connects to exactly one record in another table.

1:Many Relationship
One record connects to multiple records.

Many:1 Relationship
Many records connect to one record.

Many:Many Relationship
Records in both tables connect to multiple records, usually via a bridge table.

Joins

INNER JOIN
Returns only matching records between tables.

LEFT JOIN
Returns all records from left table + matching from right.

RIGHT JOIN
Returns all from right table + matching from left.

FULL OUTER JOIN
Returns all records whether matched or not.

Simulated FULL JOIN
Achieved by UNION of LEFT + RIGHT joins.

CROSS JOIN
Returns every combination of rows (cartesian product).

SELF JOIN
Joins a table with itself.

DISTINCT + JOINS
Removes duplicate rows after joining tables.

CTE (Common Table Expression)
A CTE is a temporary, readable result set you create inside a query to simplify complex logic.
WITH Clause (for CTEs)
The WITH clause defines a CTE so you can use it like a temporary table in the following SELECT.
Recursive CTE
A recursive CTE repeatedly runs itself to process hierarchical or tree-like data.
Advantages of CTE
CTEs make queries easier to read, reuse, debug, and organize compared to big subqueries.

Temporary Tables
A temporary table is a table created for short-term use within your session and disappears automatically afterward.
Local Temp Table
A temp table that exists only for your session and is deleted when your connection closes.
Global Temp Table
A temp table that can be used by other sessions until all sessions stop using it.
Advantages of Temp Tables
Best when you need to store and reuse intermediate results across multiple queries.
Difference: CTE vs Temp Table
CTE is query-time temporary and not stored; a temp table is physically created and can be reused across steps.

Views
A view is a saved SQL SELECT query that acts like a virtual table you can read from anytime.
Materialized View (if supported)
A materialized view stores actual data from the query rather than running it every time.
Advantages of Views
Views simplify complex queries, hide sensitive columns, and make data access easier.
Updatable Views
Some views let you insert, update, or delete data directly if the underlying query meets certain rules.
Difference: View vs Table
A table stores real data; 
a view only shows data using a stored SELECT query.
Difference: View vs CTE
A CTE works only inside one query; 
a view is permanent and can be reused anytime.

When to Use What? (Simple Guide)
Use a CTE when you need a clean, readable subquery inside one big query.
Use a Temp Table when you need to store results temporarily and reuse them multiple times.
Use a View when you want to save a complex SELECT query for repeated use like a virtual table.
